Static vs Dynamic Libraries - Quick Guide
==========================================

START HERE!
-----------

For simple, easy-to-understand examples:

1. STATIC LIBRARY:
   cd "1 - Static libraries"
   make run

2. DYNAMIC LIBRARY:
   cd "2 - Dynamic libraries"
   make run

Each folder has its own README with detailed explanations.

Key Differences at a Glance:
-----------------------------

STATIC (.a files):
  ✓ Library code INSIDE executable
  ✓ Larger file size
  ✓ No .a file needed at runtime
  ✗ Must recompile to update library

DYNAMIC (.so files):
  ✓ Library code SEPARATE from executable
  ✓ Smaller file size
  ✓ Can update library independently
  ✗ .so file MUST be present at runtime

---

Try This:
---------

1. Build both examples
2. Compare file sizes
3. Run "make test-dependency" in dynamic example
4. See what happens when .so is missing!

Happy learning!
