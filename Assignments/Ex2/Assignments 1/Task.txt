ASSIGNMENT IDEAS FOR SYSTEM PROGRAMMING 1
==========================================

1. MODULAR CALCULATOR
    - Create a calculator using multiple source files
    - Implement operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) in separate .c files
    - Use header files for function declarations
    - Build using a Makefile with separate compilation
    - Use preprocessor directives for configuration (e.g., DEBUG mode)

2. UNIT CONVERTER LIBRARY
    - Build a static library for unit conversions
    - Functions: celsius_to_fahrenheit, km_to_miles, kg_to_pounds, etc.
    - Create a Makefile to build the library (.a file)
    - Write a client program that links against the library
    - Use #define for conversion constants

3. TEXT STATISTICS ANALYZER
    - Read characters from stdin one at a time
    - Count: letters, digits, spaces, special characters
    - Calculate percentages using only simple variables
    - Use preprocessor macros for character classification
    - Build with multi-target Makefile (debug/release)

4. CONDITIONAL COMPILATION PROJECT
    - Write a program with platform-specific code
    - Use #ifdef to support LINUX, WINDOWS, MAC configurations
    - Different output messages or behaviors per platform
    - Makefile with targets for different builds
    - Practice with -D compiler flags

5. MATH LIBRARY WRAPPER
    - Create wrapper functions around <math.h>
    - Add error checking and logging
    - Build as shared library (.so)
    - Include guards in headers
    - Makefile with automatic dependency generation

6. BITWISE OPERATIONS TOOLKIT
    - Library of bitwise manipulation functions
    - set_bit, clear_bit, toggle_bit, check_bit
    - print_binary, count_ones, reverse_bits
    - Use only int/long variables (no arrays)
    - Conditional compilation for 32/64 bit systems

7. MULTI-FILE GAME (Number Guessing)
    - Split into: input.c, logic.c, output.c, main.c
    - Each module with its own header
    - Use #define for game parameters (MAX_TRIES, RANGE)
    - Makefile with clean, rebuild targets
    - Practice linking multiple object files

LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
- Modular programming and code organization
- Header files and include guards
- Makefiles (compilation, linking, dependencies)
- Static and shared libraries
- Preprocessor directives (#define, #ifdef, #include)
- Separate compilation
- Project structure
